# Overview

I wrote this text-based RPG for my kids to play. It was an opportunity for me to learn more about the Java language while working on a fun project that can be used and built upon moving forward.

Additional features added:

-Colored Text
-Extra levels
-Choice with consequence (alternate ending)
-Restart game feature

# Development Environment

I used VSCode and the Java Dev Kit to develop this software.

I coded this program in the Java language and used the java.util.Scanner library. I also set up the java.util.Random library to be used in a future version of the game that will have randomized damage.
